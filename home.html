   <h1>About the Video Game Dataset</h1>
   <p>The data used as part of this project is from the <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/index.html">CORGIS Datasets Project</a>. 
     For this webapp I am using the Video Games data rom that website, which can be found <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/video_games/">here</a>.</p>
   <p>Included in this dataset is information of games released from 2004 until 2010. That information includes the name, publisher, rating, sales and, if applicable, average playtimes. 
     Playtime will be listed as hours for whichever category is chosen (average playtime, average completion playtime, average main story playtime, etc.)</p>
    <p>Two peices to note: First, a playtime of 0 for any game means that section of data was not polled for (i.e. the polled category for that section also equals zero). 
      Second is that sales are recorded in millions of dollars, which is why they will appear as decimals.</p>
